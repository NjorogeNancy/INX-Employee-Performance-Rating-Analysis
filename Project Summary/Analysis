Analytics done on this project includes but not limited to:
- data cleaning
- data mapping
- EDA
- model building
- feature importance

Tools used included pandas,seaborn,matplotlib,numpy and scikit-learn

Three classification algorithms were trained and evaluated,i.e, Logistic Regression,Decision Tree And Random Forest.They were all trained on stratified train-test split,class balanced training and evaluated with accuracy and f1 score

Random Forest model was the best due to it's accuracy,robusness and ability to capture complex HR datasets and was therefore selected as the final predictive model.

No dimensionality reduction(e.g PCA) was done since the data was structured
